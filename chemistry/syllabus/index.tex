\section{Course Content}
\label{sec:org4121ed4}

Chemistry is a laboratory-based college-preparatory course. Laboratory experiments provide the empirical basis for understanding and confirming concepts. This course lays the foundation for further studies in Chemistry and also serves as an Advanced Placement (AP) Chemistry readiness course.This course meets the Grades 9-12 District physical science requirement and the one year of the University of California ‘d’ entrance requirement for laboratory science.
