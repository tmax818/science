** vocabulary
-  vector::magnitude in a direction
- scalar::magnitude without direction
- position::location,it's a vector
- distance::used to measure position within a frame of reference
- displacement:: 
- speed::
- velocity::
- acceleration
- system
- free-body diagram
- magnitude
- net force
- Newton's first law
- inertia
- Newton's second law
** lesson 1: describing motion
*** objectives
- Explain the difference between [[id:vector][vector]] and [[scalar][scalar]] quantities, and distinguish between [[position][position]], [[distance][distance]], [[speed][speed]], and [[velocity][velocity]].
- Use mathematical models to predict the motion of an object moving at a constant velocity or experiencing constant [[acceleration][acceleration]].
- Interpret different types of graphs to describe an object’s motion.


*** vector
- both magnitude and direction
*** scalar
*** position
*** distance
*** displacement
*** speed
- the magnitude of velocity
*** velocity
- change in position(displacement) with respect to time $$ \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} $$
- v = v_0 + at 
*** acceleration
- rate of change of velocity over time
- vector quantity
** lesson 2: forces
*** objectives
- Identify and explain the forces that result from various interactions, such as the tension [[force][force]] that acts on an object attached to a taut rope, or the buoyant force that acts on an object in a fluid.
- Model the forces acting on an object or system using a [[free-body diagram][free-body diagram]].
- Use diagrams and models to determine if the forces acting on an object or system are balanced or unbalanced.
- Apply vector addition to determine the magnitude and direction of the net force acting on an object or system.


*** force
- push or pull
- four forces
  - gravity
  - electromagnetism
  - weak nuclear
  - strong nuclear


*** free-body diagram
** lesson 3: Newton's first and second laws
* unit 2: force pairs and momentum
* unit 3: gravitation
* unit 4: electrostatics
* unit 5: energy
* unit 6: electromagnetics
* unit 7: electromagnetic radiation
* unit 8 nuclear physics
