	Objectives
	Teaching tips
	* Describe the attraction and repulsion between electric charges. 
* Explain what it means for an object to have a net charge that is positive or negative.
* Describe how a charge behaves in an electric field. 
* Apply mathematical thinking to explain how the electric force between two objects is affected by the charges of the objects and by the distance between their centers using Coulomb’s law.
	* Introduce the unit with a short lesson on the charges of subatomic particles, and elicit students’ ideas about how charges behave. 
* Guide students to compare and contrast Coulomb’s law with Newton’s law of gravitation. A Venn diagram may help students organize their ideas. Highlight that both laws exhibit inverse square relationships, and that both forces depend on separation distance.
* Use demonstrations (such as showing the interaction between charged balloons) to illustrate the relationships between electric force, charge, and distance. 
* The PhET activity “Coulomb’s Law” provides a virtual exploration of Coulomb’s law, and includes visuals to enhance student understanding of the relationships between variables. Have students create a data table to record the magnitude of force between the objects as the distance between them increases, then model the relationship with a graph of force vs distance. The graph will show an inverse square relationship. Consider following up the activity with discussion questions. Here are some sample questions:
   * How does the force acting on each charged object at the macro scale compare in magnitude and direction when the amount of charge is the same? How do they compare when one charge is twice as strong as the other? Which of Newton’s laws describes the behavior of this force pair?
   * How does the force acting on each charged object at the macro scale object change as the distance between the charges increases? If the distance between each object was doubled, how would the force change?
* Use a hands-on activity to help students understand the "why" behind an inverse square relationship. Have them shine a flashlight through a 1 cm square cutout onto a sheet of 1 cm grid paper so the light initially fills one square. Then, double the distance between the cutout and the paper, and record how many squares the light now covers. Repeat this process several times and create a corresponding graph to reveal an inverse square relationship.

	Objectives
	Teaching tips
	* Develop and use models to explain the process of electric charge polarization and describe the distribution of charge on a polarized object.
* Explain how friction can facilitate the transfer of charge between materials to produce static electricity.
* Apply an understanding of static electricity to construct explanations of real-world interactions, such as a charged balloon attracting neutral paper bits by analyzing charge transfer, electric forces, and polarization.


	* Explain that the term "electrostatic force" specifically describes the electric force between stationary (or slow-moving) charged particles or objects.

* Explain that contact forces, such as friction and tension, are a result of electrostatic forces between the atoms of each surface in contact.
* Use short activities or demonstrations that allow students to explore static electricity. For an inquiry-based approach, provide student groups with a set of materials (such as balloons, cloth strips, fleece, pieces of PVC pipe, aluminum foil, string, etc.) and allow them to explore the effects of static electricity in an open-ended manner. Have them record their findings about static electricity and compare observations.
* Use the PhET simulation “Balloons and Static Electricity” as a class opener activity to prompt discussions about how objects can become charged through friction, and how polarization can lead to a charged object (balloon) sticking to a neutral object (wall).
* Implement the hands-on activity “Why do clothes develop static cling in a dryer?” for a deeper exploration of Coulomb’s law, the electrostatic force, and static electricity (see Lesson 3).

Example phenomenon  
How can a thunderstorm make your hair stand on end?
Background information
A lightning strike is a serious threat during a thunderstorm. Lightning fatalities in the United States average around twenty per year, and hundreds more are injured from lightning strikes. Lightning occurs either between different parts of a thunderstorm, or between the storm and the ground. One warning sign of an imminent cloud to ground lightning strike is the sensation of prickly skin or hair visibly standing on end. Both of these effects are the result of a buildup of electrostatic charge.

For lightning to occur, a thunderstorm must extend high enough into the atmosphere to support the formation of hailstones. Strong updrafts carry liquid water droplets to the freezing cold upper regions of the storm, while downdrafts push hailstones toward the ground. 
Collisions between hailstones and water droplets cause the transfer of electrons to the hailstones. As a result, hailstones become negatively charged and move toward the base of the thunderstorm, while the smaller positively charged droplets are carried to the top. This process causes the base of the thunderstorm to accumulate a large negative charge, while the top builds a large positive charge.  
 
The negative charge at the thunderstorm’s  base repels electrons on the ground below. This results in a positive charge on the ground and on objects, including people. Although the base of a thunderstorm may be several kilometers above the ground, the magnitude of the charge present at the base is large enough to interact with objects on the ground. A person underneath the thunderstorm may feel their hair stand on end as their body becomes positively charged with static electricity. 
Many people have taken photos of themselves experiencing this effect, not realizing that they were in danger of being struck by lightning.


Exploring this phenomenon helps students develop and master the following understandings:
* Friction or contact between materials can transfer electrons and lead to a net charge on the objects.
* Opposite charges attract, while like charges repel.
* Coulomb’s law describes the relationship between electric force, charge, and distance.
* The electric field from a charged object can redistribute charges on nearby objects.


	Tips for implementing phenomenon-based learning
* Rub a balloon on your hair to facilitate a charge transfer between the balloon and your body. When the balloon is moved away, the hair will stand on end.  A doll with long hair or a stuffed animal with long fur also works well. Students may have experienced a similar occurrence when removing a sweater or pullover coat. This is best performed on a day with low humidity. Individual strands of hair will separate from each other because they have the same charge. Ask students to explain what they observe using key terms and ideas from the unit. 
* A Van de Graaff generator is a fantastic way to explore this phenomenon. Inside the generator, a moving belt transfers electrons away from the metal dome, leaving a net positive electric charge. Before starting the generator, place a hand on the dome, then start it. Your body will also develop a positive charge, and you may see the hairs on your arms and head begin standing on end. A doll with long hair or a stuffed animal with long fur also work well to show the effect. Individual strands of hair will separate from each other because they have the same charge. Ask students to explain what they observe using key terms and ideas from the unit. The discharge and resulting spark that may occur when removing your hands from the generator is a phenomenon that will be discussed in unit 6.
* There are numerous images and videos available on the internet that show people experiencing the buildup of static electricity beneath a thunderstorm. Use these videos and images to introduce the phenomenon. Follow up with a discussion about thunderstorm and lightning safety. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides lots of resources about lightning safety. 
* Challenge students to create a lightning safety awareness poster that includes an explanation of why the hair standing on end phenomenon is a sign of danger, and steps they can take to remain safe in a thunderstorm.
* You can revisit this phenomenon with your students in unit 6 to explore why lightning strikes occur.
* For more information about the process of lightning formation, check out this article by NOAA.
* To learn more about Michael and Sean Miquilken and their experience, check out this article by NBC.
* Prompts to engage student thinking:
   * What causes a person’s hair to stand on end when they’re in the positively charged area beneath a thunderstorm? What causes the individual hair strands to separate from each other?
   * What happens to the negative charges in the area below a thunderstorm?
   * Why can the charge at the base of a thunderstorm interact with objects on the ground, even though the storm is several kilometers above the surface?
   * How is the process of charge separation in a thunderstorm similar to other processes that generate static electricity, such as rubbing your feet on carpet?

Common student misconceptions
Possible misconception: Charged objects can only attract or repel other charged objects.
Students may incorrectly conclude that the electrostatic force can only affect macroscopic objects that have a net charge. Students may not recognize the role of polarization in allowing charged objects to interact with net neutral objects.
	Critical concepts
* An electric field exists around all charged objects. This electric field creates an electric force that acts on other charges within the field.
* An electric field can induce a temporary redistribution of charged particles within the atoms of a neutral object. This process, called polarization, creates regions of partial positive and negative charge while the overall object remains electrically neutral.
* When a polarized object is no longer in the presence of an external electric field, its charged particles will return to their original distribution and the polarized regions will no longer be present.
	How to address this misconception
Demonstrations are an excellent means to address students’ misunderstandings about the attraction and repulsion of objects due to the electrostatic force. Show charged objects attract neutral objects using simple examples, such as a charged comb picking up neutral bits of paper or a charged balloon sticking to a wall. Before charging one object in the demonstration, be sure to show students how it behaves while neutral (a neutral comb will not interact with the paper pieces, and a neutral balloon will not stick to the wall). Use models along with the demonstrations that guide students through the process of polarization before, during, and after a neutral object interacts with a charged object. You can find an example of this, along with a thorough exploration of polarization in the hands-on activity for this unit, “Why do clothes develop static cling in a dryer?”
	

Possible misconception: Friction creates charges that cause static electricity to build up on objects.
Students may misunderstand the role of friction in charging objects and the fundamental nature of electric charge. Friction does not create charges; rather, it facilitates the transfer of existing electrons between materials, which results in a net charge on the materials. Matter typically contains (approximately) equal numbers of protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge), making it electrically neutral under normal conditions. When two materials come into contact and are then separated, friction can cause electrons to transfer from one material to the other, leaving one object with a net positive charge and the other with a net negative charge. The resulting charge on each material depends on the materials’ tendencies to gain or lose electrons. The total charge remains conserved, meaning no new charges are created—only redistributed.
	Critical concepts
* Charged particles (protons and electrons) exist in all matter, and objects are naturally neutral unless charge is transferred.
* Static electricity results from the imbalance of charges on an object.
* When two objects come into contact, electrons can transfer between them, leading to a charge imbalance. Friction often enhances this process by increasing the contact between surface areas, facilitating more electron transfer.
* Insulators build up static electricity more easily than conductors.
	How to address this misconception
It is essential for students to understand that there are two types of electric charge (positive and negative), and that each type of net charge arises from the transfer of electrons. Engage students with a demonstration that shows how these two types of charges can be induced through electron transfer using the same set of materials. For example, use two balloons and a piece of cloth (wool works well). 
* Rub the cloth on one of the balloons. Electrons will transfer from the cloth to the balloon, resulting in a positive net charge on the cloth and a negative net charge on the balloon. The two materials will stick together from the electrostatic force. 
* Next rub the cloth onto both balloons. The cloth will transfer electrons to the balloons, giving each a negative net charge. Bring the balloons near each other and they will repel due to the electrostatic forces.
* Supplement the demonstration with diagrams that guide students through the processes seen in the demonstration. Highlight the process of charge transfer that occurs during the demonstration. The PhET simulation “Balloons and Static Electricity” provides an excellent visual of charge transfer.
