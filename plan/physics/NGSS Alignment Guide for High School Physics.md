# NGSS Alignment Guide for High School Physics

#  This guide outlines how the Khan Academy high school physics course aligns with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). NGSS is built around a three-dimensional approach:

| Performance Expectations (PEs) Each unit is aligned with specific PEs that blend all three dimensions—DCIs, SEPs, and CCCs—into meaningful, assessable learning goals that reflect what students should know and be able to do. |  |  |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs)** | **Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs)** | **Crosscutting Concepts (CCCs)** |
| Describe the behaviors that scientists engage in as they investigate the natural world and that engineers use to design and build solutions. These practices go beyond “skills”—they involve applying content knowledge in purposeful ways. | Help students make connections across the different domains of science. By making these ideas explicit, instruction helps students build a coherent, transferable understanding of science that they can apply in new and unfamiliar contexts. | Key ideas that are central to understanding the physical sciences, life sciences, Earth and space sciences, and engineering. These ideas have broad relevance across scientific disciplines and build in complexity across grade levels. |

**Performance expectations (PEs)**

* **HS-PS3-1:** Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.

* **HS‑PS3‑5:** Develop and use a model of two objects interacting through electric or magnetic fields to illustrate the forces between objects and the changes in energy of the objects due to the interaction.

---

**Disciplinary core ideas (DCIs)**

* **HS‑PS3.A.2:** Energy is a quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system. That there is a single quantity called energy is due to the fact that a system’s total energy is conserved, even as, within the system, energy is continually transferred from one object to another and between its various possible forms.

* **HS‑PS3.A.3:** At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways, such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy.

* **HS‑PS3.A.4:** These relationships are better understood at the microscopic scale, at which all of the different manifestations of energy can be modeled as a combination of energy associated with the motion of particles and energy associated with the configuration (relative position of the particles). In some cases the relative position energy can be thought of as stored in fields (which mediate interactions between particles). This last concept includes radiation, a phenomenon in which energy stored in fields moves across space.

* **HS-PS3.B.1:** Conservation of energy means that the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system.

* **HS-PS3.B.2:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transported from one place to another and transferred between systems.

* **HS‑PS3.B.3:** Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on its configuration (e.g. relative positions of charged particles, compression of a spring) and how kinetic energy depends on mass and speed, allow the concept of conservation of energy to be used to predict and describe system behavior.

* **HS‑PS3.B.4:** The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system.

* **HS‑PS3.C.1:** When two objects interacting through a field change relative position, the energy stored in the field is changed.

* **HS‑PS3.D.1:** Although energy cannot be destroyed, it can be converted to less useful forms—for example, to thermal energy in the surrounding environment.

* **HS‑ETS1.A:** Criteria and constraints also include satisfying any requirements set by society, such as taking issues of risk mitigation into account, and they should be quantified to the extent possible and stated in such a way that one can tell if a given design meets them.

|  | **Analyzing and interpreting data:** Students progress to introducing more detailed statistical analysis, the comparison of data sets for consistency, and the use of models to generate and analyze data. |
|  | **Constructing explanations and designing solutions:** Students progress to explanations and designs that are supported by multiple and independent student-generated sources of evidence consistent with scientific ideas, principles, and theories. |

### **Crosscutting concepts (CCCs)**

| Crosscutting concept | Unit implementation |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Systems and system models:** Defining the system under study—specifying its boundaries and making explicitly a model of that system—provides tools for understanding and testing ideas that are applicable throughout science and engineering. | Students utilize models of nuclear changes to explain what happens during nuclear decay and nuclear reactions. |
| **Energy and matter:** Flows, cycles, and conservation. Tracking fluxes of energy and matter into, out of, and within systems helps one understand the systems’ possibilities and limitations. | Students evaluate the mass loss that occurs during  nuclear reactions to explain why fission and fusion release large amounts of energy. |
| **Stability and change:** For natural and built systems alike, conditions of stability and determinants of rates of change or evolution of a system are critical elements of study. | Students investigate how radioisotopes undergo nuclear changes to become stable. |
| **Patterns:** Observed patterns of forms and events guide organization and classification, and they prompt questions about relationships and the factors that influence them. | Students recognize patterns in the decay rates of radioisotopes and use the concept of half-life to make predictions about the remaining quantity of a substance over time, the age of geological and archaeological samples, and the stability of different isotopes. |
