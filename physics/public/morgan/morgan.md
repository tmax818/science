The Factor Label Method
1) How many grams of vitamin C are in a 1500 mg tablet?
a. Start from the number you are given. (1500 mg)
b. Write a fraction with the units you wish to divide out (mg in this case) on the bottom and the
base units (the one you want to get this time)— the ones without a prefix — (grams) on the top.
c. Which units are bigger? (grams) Put a big 1 next to them. (1 g)
d. How many of the smaller units does it take to make one of the bigger? (1000 mg make 1
gram) Put this number next to the smaller units.
