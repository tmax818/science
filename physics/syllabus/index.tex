\section{Course Content}
\label{sec:org5c92d93}

Physics is a laboratory-based college-preparatory course. Laboratory experiments provide the empirical basis for understanding and confirming concepts. This course lays the foundation for further studies in Physics and also serves as an Advanced Placement (AP) Physics readiness course.This course meets the Grades 9-12 District physical science requirement and the one year of the University of California "d" entrance requirement for laboratory science.

\section{Grading Policy - also how parents/students can find out their grades}
\label{sec:orgbf16ff4}
\subsection{Academic Grade}
\label{sec:org1178606}
\subsubsection{What is included in the academic grade?}

\textbf{\textbf{Students that are in danger of failing will be scheduled for after-school tutoring and periodic parent/teacher conferences will be mandatory.}} until the course grade has improved.

\subsection{Work Habits Grade and Cooperation Grade}
\label{sec:org68458f7}

\section{Suggested Materials}
\label{sec:org545b9bb}
Students will be provided a notebook for organization of class and laboratory notes.
\section{Planner Policy/Bathroom Policy}
\label{sec:org7161c85}
Students may not use the restroom during the first or last ten minutes of each class period. One student is allowed out of the class at a time, and students must take \textbf{\textbf{their}} signed planner. Bathroom breaks are not to exceed five minutes unless there is an explicit reason that is communicated to the teacher.
\section{Cell Phone Policy}
\label{sec:orgdf38493}
LAUSD official policy states that \textbf{\textbf{students are not permitted to use cell phones or any other non-school-issued electronic devices during instructional time}}. The first instance of non-compliance will result in a verbal warning. Subsequent non-compliance will result in  the device being kept in the office for the remainder of the school day, to be picked up by the student after school. Any further instances of non-compliance will result in the device being kept in the office until a legal guardian arrives to pick it up.

\section{Homework expectations}
\label{sec:org6b59abd}
All assignments must be completed by the deadline specified on Schoology. Late work will be accepted at the teacher's discression. 
\section{Tutoring Information}
\label{sec:org62796f8}
Tutoring will be offered on Thrusday after school, or by appointment.
\section{Connections to Performing Arts in Core Curriculum}
